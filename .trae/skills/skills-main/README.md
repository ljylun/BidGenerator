## Get Your Octagon API Key

1. Sign up for a free account at [Octagon](https://app.octagonai.co/signup/?redirectToAfterSignup=https://app.octagonai.co/api-keys)
2. After logging in, from left menu, navigate to **API Keys**
3. Generate a new API key
4. Save the key securely - you'll need it for configuration

## Prerequisites

Before using these skills, you need to have `npx` (which comes with Node.js and npm) installed on your system.

### Mac (macOS)

1. **Install Homebrew** (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. **Install Node.js (includes npm and npx):**
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   npx -v
   ```

### Windows

1. **Download the Node.js installer:**
   - Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version for Windows.
2. **Run the installer** and follow the prompts. This will install Node.js, npm, and npx.
3. **Verify installation:**
   Open Command Prompt and run:
   ```cmd
   node -v
   npm -v
   npx -v
   ```

If you see version numbers for all three, you are ready to proceed.

## MCP Setup

### Cursor

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to **Features > MCP Servers**
3. Click **+ Add New MCP Server**
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: `octagon-mcp`
   - **Type**: `command`
   - **Command**: `env OCTAGON_API_KEY=<your-api-key> npx -y octagon-mcp`

Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual Octagon API key.

**Windows users:** Use this command format instead:
```
cmd /c "set OCTAGON_API_KEY=<your-api-key> && npx -y octagon-mcp"
```

After adding, refresh the MCP server list to see the new tools. Access the Composer via Command+L (Mac), select "Agent" next to the submit button, and enter your query.

### Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config
3. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octagon-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "octagon-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OCTAGON_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude for the changes to take effect

### Windsurf

Add this to your `./codeium/windsurf/model_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octagon-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "octagon-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OCTAGON_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Verify the key is correctly set in the command string with no extra spaces.
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure you have internet connectivity and the Octagon API is accessible.
- **Rate Limiting**: Reduce query frequency if encountering rate limit errors.
